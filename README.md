# Mustang S550 IPC Hebrew Support

Add Hebrew language support to the Mustang S550 instrument cluster (IPC) by modifying fonts and firmware for proper Hebrew display.

---

## Installation

To install Hebrew language support on your IPC:

- Just flash all the files from the [Mustang Buillit Firmware Hebrew](https://github.com/Deathstars/mustang-s550-ipc-hebrew/tree/main/Mustang%20Buillit%20Firmware%20Hebrew) folder to your instrument cluster using UCDS or a compatible flashing tool.
- Once complete, your IPC will support Hebrew display.

> **Note:** This project was tested using UCDS to flash the IPC, but it may also work with other tools.
